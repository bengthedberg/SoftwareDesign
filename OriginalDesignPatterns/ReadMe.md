# Design Patterns

The origins of the design patterns that are prevalent in software architecture today were born from the experiences and knowledge of programmers over many years of using object-oriented programming languages. A set of the most common patterns were catalogued in a book entitled Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software, more affectionately known as the Design Patterns Bible. This book was written by Erich Gamma, Richard Helm, Ralph Johnson, and John Vlissides, better known as the Gang of Four. They collected 23 design patterns and organized them into 3 groups:  
* **Creational Patterns**:  
These deal with object construction and referencing. 
* **Structural Patterns**:  
These deal with the relationships between objects and how they interact with each other to form larger complex objects. 
* **Behavioral Patterns**:  
These deal with the communication between objects, especially in terms of responsibility and algorithms.

Each pattern is presented in a template so readers can learn how to decipher and apply the pattern.
