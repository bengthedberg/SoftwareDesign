# Creational Patterns

Creational patterns deal with object construction and referencing. They abstract away the responsibility of instantiating instances of objects from the client, thus keeping code loosely coupled and the responsibility of creating complex objects in one place adhering to the Single Responsibility and Separation of Concerns principles. 

Following are the patterns in the Creational group: 

* **Abstract Factory**:  
Provides an interface to create families of related objects. 
* **Factory**:   
Enables a class to delegate the responsibility of creating a valid object. 
* **Builder**:   
Enables various versions of an object to be constructed by separating the construction for the object itself. 
* **Prototype**:   
Allows classes to be copied or cloned from a prototype instance rather than creating new instances. 
* **Singleton**:   
Enables a class to be instantiated once with a single global point of access to it.
