[**Noda Time**](https://nodatime.org/)

Noda Time is intended to fix flaws in the .NET data/time libraries and to reduce complexity in using them. 

Noda Time uses a number of key concepts: 
* **Instant** – a moment measured from the Unix epoch, 
* **Partial** – a partial data/time representation, 
* **Interval** – an interval of time from one ms instant to another, 
* **Duration** – the duration of a time interval measured in ms, 
* **Period** – a period of time expressed in fields (e.g. 5 months 3 days 6 hours), 
* **Chronology** – a pluggable calendar system, Time Zones updated based on the tz database.
